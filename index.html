                    <p>Life brings amazing opportunities to open your heart.
                        That's where Mattie comes! She needed a home.We opened our doors to her, and she opened our hearts. 
                        Mattie is a great companion and a loyal and loving family member.
                        We realized then that we had to do more for those families that needed support.
                        Canine Cares 4U was established in 2020 to serve San Diego County's canine families.
